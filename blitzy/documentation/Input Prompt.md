Set-It-and-Forget-It AI-Powered Solana Trading Bot
WHY - Vision & Purpose
Purpose & Users
	•	What problem are you solving and for whom?
	•	The bot solves the challenge of managing cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges, optimizing strategies, and managing risk in real-time without requiring constant user intervention. It is designed for advanced traders who want a fully autonomous, self-adjusting trading system that operates 24/7.
	•	What does your application do?
	•	The bot leverages AI/ML to autonomously select, execute, and optimize trading strategies across multiple Solana decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Jupiter and Pump Fun, Drift.
The bot continuously learns from market conditions to refine its approach, ensuring maximum profitability with minimal risk.
	•	Who will use it?
	•	Advanced cryptocurrency traders and investors looking for a hands-off trading solution that outperforms traditional bots by adapting dynamically to market conditions.
	•	Why will they use it instead of alternatives?
	•	Unlike pre-programmed bots or subscription-based services, this bot:
	1.	Uses cutting-edge AI/ML to self-optimize strategies and risk management.
	2.	Connects to multiple DEXs for broader market coverage.
	3.	Operates autonomously without requiring constant user input or monitoring.
	4.	Leverages Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure for efficient execution.
WHAT - Core Requirements
Functional Requirements
	•	What must the system do?
	•	Data Collection:
	•	Continuously fetch real-time price data, order books, trade volumes, and historical data from DEXs (Jupiter, Drift).
	•	Analyze on-chain activity (e.g., whale movements, liquidity changes) on Solana.
Monitors market sentiment. Scand the Solana blockchain for high opportunity trading pairs
Converts the USDC to other trading pairs automatically depending on trading pair and other relevant variables
	•	Strategy Selection & Execution:
	•	Use AI/ML models to dynamically select the most profitable trading strategy (e.g., arbitrage, trend following, grid trading).
	•	Execute trades with sub-second latency across multiple exchanges via API integrations.
	•	Risk Management:
	•	Automatically adjust stop-loss, take-profit levels, and position sizes based on market volatility.
	•	Monitor portfolio exposure and rebalance when necessary.
	•	Optimization:
	•	Continuously learn from past trades using reinforcement learning to improve future performance.
	•	Adapt to changing market conditions in real-time by recalibrating strategies.
	•	User Interface:
	•	Provide a web-based dashboard for monitoring performance metrics (ROI, win rate), configuring parameters (risk tolerance), and viewing trade history.
HOW - Planning & Implementation
Technical Implementation
Required Stack Components
	•	Frontend:
	•	Web-based dashboard using React.js or Vue.js for real-time visualization of performance metrics and configuration settings.
	•	Backend:
	•	Python for AI/ML model implementation and strategy optimization.
	•	Rust for performance-critical components like transaction execution on Solana.
	•	Integrations:
	•	APIs SDKs DEXs (Jupiter, Drift) to fetch data and execute trades.
	•	Jito Labs API for MEV optimization on Solana.
	•	Infrastructure:
	•	Cloud deployment on AWS in Singapore with autoscaling capabilities for continuous operation.
	•	PostgreSQL database for storing trade history and performance logs.
System Requirements
	•	Performance Needs:
	•	Sub-second latency for trade execution.

	•	Scalability to handle thousands of trades per second across multiple exchanges.
	•	Security Requirements:
	•	Encrypt API keys and sensitive data using AES encryption.
Scalability to handle thousands of trades per second across multiple exchanges.
	•	Security Requirements:
	•	Encrypt API keys and sensitive data using AES encryption.
	•	Scalability Expectations:
	•	Automatic and seamless addition of new trading pairs 
	•	Reliability Targets:

User Experience
Key User Flows
	1.	Entry Point: User logs into the dashboard using wallet sign in

	2.	Configuration: User funds the bot with USDC
	•
	3.	Monitoring: User views real-time performance metrics such as ROI, win rate, and trade history.
	•	Success Criteria: Data updates in real-time with clear visualizations.
	4.	Automation: Bot operates autonomously without user intervention while optimizing strategies in real-time.

	•	Success Criteria: Bot executes trades profitably while adhering to risk limits.
Business Requirements
Access & Authentication
Single-user phantom wallet sign in
Business Rules
	•	Risk management parameters must be enforced at all times to prevent catastrophic losses.
Implementation Priorities
	1.	High Priority:
	•	Real-time data collection from multiple exchanges.
	•	AI/ML-driven strategy selection and execution.
	•	Risk management automation.
	2.	Medium Priority:
	•	MEV optimization via Jito Labs integration.
	•	Web-based dashboard for monitoring and configuration.

This enhanced bot design ensures that it operates as a fully autonomous “set-it-and-forget-it” system while leveraging advanced AI/ML techniques to optimize strategies dynamically across multiple exchanges. The bot’s ability to self-adjust ensures long-term profitability while minimizing the need for user intervention.
